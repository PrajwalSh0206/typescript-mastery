## 💡 Why TypeScript?

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds **static typing**. 
1. **Catch Errors Early**: Find bugs during development instead of at runtime.
2. **Better Tooling**: Enjoy superior autocompletion and refactoring tools.
3. **Documentation**: The types themselves act as documentation for your code.
